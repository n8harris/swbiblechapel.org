			South Waterboro Bible Chapel has a bold vision and clear sense of direction. Our vision is to reach our
			neighborhoods, our town, and then beyond to the world with the Lord Jesus Christ. Our purpose within this
			vision is to:</p>
			<ol class="lead">
				<li>Evangelize the lost.</li>
	 
				<li>Establish believers in a loving, worshiping community.</li>
	 
				<li>Deploy them for ministries to their families, neighborhoods, Waterboro, and the world.</li>
			</ol>
 
			<p class="lead">
			This vision will be accomplished by equipping all our lay people to live the daily abundant Christian life and to
			minister in all spheres of influence. These spheres of influence will include the marketplace, neighborhoods,
			schools, social organizations and any other area that is available to Christian witness.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
			Our clear sense of direction is focused on the Great Commission and referenced in Matthew 28:19-20. By
			discipling our lay people to be mature, reproducing disciples, every member within South Waterboro Bible
			Chapel can contribute a vital part in the fulfillment of this vision and direction.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
			Our "Philosophy is Ministry" is based on Ephesians 4:11, which states that every Christian is a minister and
			has a place of ministry. The verse states that "He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as
			evangelists, and some as pastors/teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of the ministry to the
			building up of the body of Christ."
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
			At South Waterboro Bible Chapel,our staff serves by helping to equip the lay people for their particular
			ministry. Through the process of being a disciple, each lay person is encouraged to grow spiritually, to share
			his/her faith with others, and to be involved in a personal one-on-one fruit-bearing ministry.
