			<p class="lead">
			Pastor Dan Lambertson is a 1985 graduate of Liberty University (Lynchburg, VA) with a Bachelor of Science degree in pastoral ministries. 
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
			He grew up as a pastor's son and has been a full time pastor himself since 1986. He was ordained in 1987 by Dover Bible Church in Pennsylvania. Dan has served as pastor to churches in Maine, New York State and Pennsylvania. He has been the pastor of the South Waterboro Bible Chapel since April of 2005.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
			Dan and his wife Selena were married in 1986. God has blessed them with four children in the years since and more recently two sons-in-law and two daughters-in-law. All of their adult children are following the Lord and are either serving in various Christian ministries or are preparing through education.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
			Together with the support of his wife and family, Pastor Dan serves the church and community through preaching and teaching the Word of God. He has also coordinated and participated in several missions trips to Haiti, Mexico, Peru and special projects within the United States. 
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
			Personally, he remains healthy and active through cycling, hiking, fishing and hockey. It is his desire that God will also use these personal interests as a bridge to build relationships which lead to witnessing the good news of Jesus Christ.</p>

			<em>"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry... And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus."</em> (1 Timothy 1:12,14)</p>
