			The purpose of South Waterboro Bible Chapel is based on the Scriptural reference in Acts 2:41-43. The Scripture states
			four purposes for the New Testament church that are also the foundational purposes for our church. South Waterboro Bible
			Chapel will focus on these four purposes as the basis for all decisions and ministries:</p>
 
			<ol class="lead">
			<li>Evangelism: South Waterboro Bible Chapel exists to reach lost people for whom Christ died. Luke 19:10 tells us that
			the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost. Jesus provided salvation by His substitutionary death on the
			cross. When He ascended back into heaven, He gave the church the commission to take the Gospel into all the world.</li>
			<li>Edification: South Waterboro Bible Chapel exists to help believers become fully devoted followers of Christ. After the
			three thousand were saved and added to the church on the day of Pentecost, "they continued steadfastly in the apostles'
			doctrine." South Waterboro Bible Chapel nurtures new Christians. Edification includes nurturing, maturing, and reproducing.
			We cannot be satisfied until every believer has become a mature, reproducing disciple of the Lord Jesus.</li>
			<li>Fellowship: South Waterboro Bible Chapel exists to meet the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs within the body
			of Christ and provide a biblical means of mutual accountability. Not only did the New Testament church see three thousand
			saved and continue daily in the apostles' doctrine, they also continued steadfastly in the fellowship. Christian fellowship
			means meeting the basic needs of every individual. We are our brother’s keeper. We must be accountable to one another.</li>
			<li>Worship: South Waterboro Bible Chapel exists to worship and glorify God together as a body of believers. Borrowing
			Warren Weirsbe’s definition of worship: "Worship is the believer's response of all that he is - mind, emotions, will, and body -
			to all that God is and says and does." The ultimate purpose of our church is to glorify God and honor Him. May all that we
			do, say, or think as individual believers and as a local body of believers, bring glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
